# PyBer-Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of the assignment was to work with Omar to create a summary dataframe of ride sharing data in different city types using the Pandas and Python skills we learned earlier. Then, we demonstrate our matplotlib skills to portray a multiple line graph of the total weekly fares for different city types.

## Results

When we produced these results, we noticed that the total rides, total drivers and total fares in the urban areas exceed the amounts in suburban and rural areas by a great amount. However, the average fare per ride and driver is the highest in the rural areas. We presume that this is due to the amount of rides compared to drivers. In rural and suburban areas, the average fare per driver is higher than the average fare per ride due to the ratio between total drivers compared to rides. In urban areas, the average fare per driver is lower than the average fare per ride because of the higher amount of drivers compared to rides.

## Summary

One suggestion for the CEO is to address the difference between the average fare per ride and average fare per driver in rural areas. This could be due to longer distances between destinations or the amount of total drivers to total rides. Another suggestion is to look into the difference in total drivers to total rides in urban areas. The amount of rides could attract a high amount of drivers or the distances between the destinations could be shorter, leading to a greater profit between gas and average fare per driver. The last suggestion is to look into the slightly greater average fare per driver compared to the average fare per rides in the suburbs. This could be due to different distances for destinations and could discourage drivers, which could lead to less total drivers. However, it raises the question to why urban drivers do not seek to enter suburban driving, which has a far higher average fare per driver.
